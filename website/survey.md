We have organised a survey on the status of cybersecurity in Denmark, as part of the ASCD project.

The aim of the survey is to investigate the status of cybersecurity among Danish companies to identify the challenges companies face and look into possible solutions for these challenges. 
In the survey, we ask questions about the security and privacy practices in the organisation of the responders. 

<mark>We will use the responses for research purposes only</mark>. 
Our research team will only have access to the responses provided within the survey and we will only share the data from the survey, including publishing the results of the survey analysis in project reports and academic publications, in anonymised or aggregated form.

More information about data protection by ITU and SDU of the data from the survey responses is available at [our data protection page](/data-protection). If you have more questions or requests about the processing of your personal data, please contact our data protection officer at dpo@itu.dk.
