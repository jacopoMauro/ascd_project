Specific information about the research and the collected research data 
Title of study/project/PhD thesis: Status of CyberSecurity in Denmark

Description of the project, including the purpose of the data processing and which personal data is processed:
Data will be processed in connection with the analysis of the survey and the interviews to understand the security practices of Danish companies (as defined in the goals of the ASCD project).

The purpose of the processing is the completion and analysis of the survey and the interview answers of the ASCD project. The purpose of the survey and the interviews – is to investigate the status of cybersecurity among Danish companies in order to identify the challenges companies face and look into possible solutions for these challenges. The data will only be used for research purposes and not be shared with anyone aside from researchers from our team at both ITU and SDU working on the data analysis within the project. The results of the survey analysis will be published in project reports and academic publications in anonymized or aggregated form only.

The purpose of collecting information about the place of employment within the survey is to have a possibility to have a contact point for a follow-up study, for which we will select several organizations and conduct interviews with their employees in order to get a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and how they solve them. The data provided will only be used for arranging interviews, in case the company will be selected. When contacting the companies for conducting interviews, further data, such as names and contact information of employees to be interviewed, can be collected. This information will only be used for the purpose of arranging the interviews.

E-mail addresses of people who contact the researchers either via email or via contact form on the project website will be collected for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.

Taking part in the study/project/PhD thesis involves: 
For users, it means: Participating in survey, and participation in interviews. 
For Project team-members, it means: Creating the survey, launching the survey, participating in interviews as needed, analyzing the data from survey and interviews, creating insights and recommendations and assimilating the project in the report. 

For interviews, focus groups and observations, specify how the information is recorded (audio, video, written notes). For questionnaires, specify whether participant completes the form. For audio or video recordings, indicate whether these will be transcribed as text, and whether the recording will be destroyed: 
Survey will be conducted through the ITU standard Survey-Xact software, which will be completed by the participant.
Interviews – will be recorded in audio and written notes. Transcripts will be created in form of text. Both the recordings and the text transcripts – will be destroyed after one year of completion of the project. 

List the planned outputs, e.g. reports, publications, website, video channel etc.: 
The results of the project will be published in project reports and academic publications, in anonymized or aggregated form only.

Specify in which form the data will be deposited, e.g. anonymized transcripts, audio recording, survey database, etc.; 
The data will be deposited in: Survey-Xact database and its exports, Anonymized transcripts, audio recording, and written notes. 

Specify whether deposited data will be anonymized, and how: 
The Survey will not ask for any name or email address of the participants, and the Survey-Xact database and its exports will not contain the same also. 
For interviews, name, company and roles – will be anonymized manually at the time of the first transcription. 
Before publishing the data, it will be anonymized and the participant in the survey and interview cannot be identified. 

Specify the duration for which the data will be kept:
Within one year after the completion of the project, the personal data will be deleted or anonymized as per the joint agreement contract between ITU and SDU.

Specify whether use or access restrictions will apply to the data in future, e.g. exclude commercial use, apply safeguarded access, etc.:
Collected data will not be accessed by anyone else outside the project research team. The data will only be used for research purposes and any personal information will only be stored in access-controlled repositories. Any commercial use or exposure of the data to external parties is excluded.
